## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/GaetanBenoitDev/metaMDBG.git
cd metaMDBG
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 3
```

After successful installation, an executable named metaMDBG will appear in build/bin.


## Usage

```
./metaMDBG asm outputDir reads... {OPTIONS}

	outputDir     Output dir for contigs and temporary files
	reads...      Read filename(s) (separated by space)
